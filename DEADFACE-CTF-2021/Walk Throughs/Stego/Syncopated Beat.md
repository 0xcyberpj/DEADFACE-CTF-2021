The players are given a link to a file with a rock video.  As they play it, around two minutes in, a creepy, demonic voice can be heard, growling and snarling a hair-raising message.

Players have to decipher the message.

The players can use various tools to reverse the message, which is a voice speaking in English backwards.

The message says: "**Time is reversible, but the music is not.  Go back.  Go Back!!!  But before you do, don't forget to enter the flag, which is Electric... Light... Orchestra... all caps, separated by dashes.**"
